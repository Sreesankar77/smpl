                Veer-Zaara is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language romantic film directed and produced by Yash Chopra, and written by his son Aditya Chopra. It stars Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta as the titular star-crossed lovers: Veer Pratap Singh is an Indian Air Force officer, and Zaara Hayaat Khan is the daughter of a Pakistani politician. Veer is imprisoned on false charges, and 22 years later, a young Pakistani lawyer, named Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), fights his case. Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Divya Dutta, Manoj Bajpayee, Boman Irani, Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher play supporting roles.

Chopra expressed his desire to make a comeback to the film industry after a gap of seven years, as he was unsatisfied with the scripts he had been offered. It was during this time that Aditya narrated a few scenes from a story he had written, which intrigued Chopra and sparked his interest to direct it. Chopra envisioned the film as a tribute to Punjab, aiming to capture the essence of the region. It was to be titled Yeh Kahaan Aa Gaye Hum, based on an eponymous song from Yash Chopra's Silsila (1981). Set in India and Pakistan, principal photography took place in Indian Punjab and in Mumbai; parts of the film were also shot in Pakistan. The soundtrack album, based on old compositions by Madan Mohan with lyrics by Javed Akhtar, was the highest-selling album of the year in India.

Veer-Zaara was released on 12 November 2004 during Diwali. The film earned over ₹97 crore worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. It received universal acclaim, especially for its story, dialogues, soundtrack, performances and sensitive portrayal of India-Pakistan relations. It was described by analysts as having themes pertaining to a shared Punjabi culture, secularism and feminism, among others. Veer-Zaara is ranked among the greatest romantic films of Indian cinema.

At the 52nd National Film Awards, Veer-Zaara won Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. At the 50th Filmfare Awards, the film received a leading 15 nominations, and won 4 awards, including Best Film and Best Story (Aditya). At the 6th IIFA Awards, it won a leading 7 awards of its 11 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Chopra), Best Actor (Khan), Best Supporting Actress (Mukerji) and Best Music Director (Mohan).

                The government of Pakistan decides to review unsolved cases pertaining to their Indian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. Saamiya Siddiqui, a budding Pakistani lawyer, is given the defense of prisoner 786 as her first case. The prisoner, documented under the name Rajesh Rathore, has not spoken for twenty-two years. However, when Saamiya addresses him by his real name, Veer Pratap Singh, he breaks his silence and opens up to her about his story.

Twenty-two years earlier, Zaara Hayaat Khan was a lively young Pakistani woman whose family has a political background and is of high standing in Lahore. Her engagement is arranged with Raza Shirazi, a wealthy and influential lawyer. Zaara travels to India to fulfill the last wish of her Sikh nanny: to have her ashes scattered in the Sutlej River. Her bus met with an accident. Veer, then an Indian Air Force pilot and a Punjabi Sikh, rescues Zaara and helps her complete her nanny's final wish. She accompanies him to his village to celebrate the festival of Lohri, where she meets his loving aunt and uncle, who raised him.

The next day, Veer takes Zaara to the train station for her return to Pakistan and is shocked to see her fiancé Raza there to accompany her. Veer confesses that he has fallen in love with her, accepting that they cannot be together. Both depart, believing they will never meet again. Amidst her wedding preparations back home, Zaara realises that she too is in love with Veer. Her mother, however, is against this, as marrying Raza will further her father's political career. Zaara's friend Shabbo secretly calls Veer, begging him to take Zaara away. He promptly quits the Indian Air Force and arrives in Pakistan. Zaara tearfully runs into his arms, causing her father to fall ill with shock and anger.

Zaara's mother begs Veer to leave Zaara, fearing for her father's reputation and health. Veer respects this and attempts to return home but Raza, outraged and jealous, has him arrested by Pakistani police. He blackmails Veer with two choices: be imprisoned for life on charges of being an Indian spy, with Raza giving Zaara a life full of happiness, or walk free knowing that Raza will make Zaara's life a living hell. Veer sacrifices his freedom out of his deep love for Zaara and is imprisoned in Pakistan. Meanwhile, his return bus falls off a cliff, killing all the passengers, so he is presumed dead to the world.

Veer requests Saamiya not to mention Zaara whilst fighting the case, believing that she must be married by now; he does not want to ruin her reputation or make her settled life difficult. Saamiya travels to his village to find someone who can prove his true identity. She is shocked to find Zaara and Shabbo at his home.

Shabbo explains that after Zaara thought Veer died in the bus accident 22 years ago, she broke off the marriage with Raza with her father's support. Her parents and Veer's aunt and uncle all eventually passed away within a few years. With the Hayat Khan family basically perished, Zaara and Shabbo left Pakistan and settled in Veer's village in India to fulfill Veer's dream of developing their village further.

Zaara is shocked to learn that Veer is alive. She accompanies Saamiya back to Pakistan, where the old lovers share an emotional reunion. Her statement and evidence in court prove Veer's innocence and true identity. The judge frees him, apologizing on behalf of Pakistan. Veer and Zaara marry, bid goodbye to Saamiya at the Wagah border crossing, and return home, finally able to live their lives together.
