                Ahammadali Sulaiman is the godfather of Ramadapally, a coastal town in Thiruvananthapuram where Muslims and Christians live together. He prepares to undertake the Hajj pilgrimage in his middle years on the insistence of his Christian wife Roselyn. Ali and his friend Aboobacker, a political leader, are on the verge of fallout over land acquisition from the locals for a harbour project. At the airport, the police arrest Ali under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA).

The police assign Shibu, a goon to kill Ali in custody extrajudicially but he dies in an explosion. They then intimidate Freddy, a juvenile arrested for throwing steel bombs at the police, into doing it. Freddy is the son of David Christudas, Roselyn's elder brother and Sulaiman's nephew. David was a friend of Ali's but now holds a grudge against him.

On the police's insistence, Ali's mother Jameela meets Freddy. In the 1960s, the Muslims and Christians of Ramadapally lived in harmony. The Christian fishermen community primarily lived in its Edavathura suburb. Ali, David, Peter and Hameed dropped out of school and engaged in petty crimes, working for Chandran, a local goon. Chandran disowned them after Ali sends trash dumped at the local mosque back to the disposers. Ali and his friends started smuggling on their own and he sets up his own shop.

Ali's earnestness impressed the sub-collector Anwar Ali. Ali asked Anwar to clear the garbage dump and build a school there. Wanting to settle scores, Chandran sets fire to their godown and the children working there die. Ali kills Chandran in retaliation. Anwar questions Ali, who confesses to his crime, and challenges Anwar to arrest him before Ramadapally's residents. Forced to leave, Anwar extracted a promise from Jameela to testify against Ali. Jameela asks Freddy not to kill Ali and says he should be brought before the law. David and his wife visit Freddy in jail and Freddy enquires why David hates Ali.

A look out notice was issued against Ali and he absconded to Minicoy, Lakshadweep along with David and Roselyn. Ali and Roselyn are married with David's approval. Ali gained Roselyn's approval to raise their children as Muslims. When David returned to the coast, David's father told him that the police beat their men and raped their women. Anwar told David that the Muslims reaped the benefits and the consequences were suffered by the coastal Christian fishermen. David was appalled but conflicted. He convinced Ali to appear before the court. Ali's mother gave a statement against Ali and he was remanded for three months. Roselyn gave birth to a boy who David named Antony and performed his baptism. When Ali is released, he interrupts the ritual and shouts at David. He names his son Ameer. David is aggrieved and ends his friendship with Ali.

Ali received a consignment of smuggled weapons which he refused and hid under a pit. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake strikes and causes disproportionate losses to the Christian fishermen community there. Ali engages in the humanitarian efforts. He continually opposes development projects that displace the locals. Anwar, the police, and MLA P. A. Aboobacker, who is playing both sides for the land acquisition, manipulated David into starting a riot at the mosque premises during Uroos celebrations. Aboo's goons murder a fellow and pin it on David, leading to a fight between Christians and Muslims. Ameer was killed in police firing. Some of the local goons use the hidden weapons and a bloody riot occurs. Ali's supporters ride a car over Anwar. David is shot by Ali's goons and becomes disabled.

David and his wife ask Freddy to follow through with his task. He is transferred into Ali's cell. Freddy attempts to strangle Ali during Fajr prayer but fails. Ali breaks down and blames David for his son's death and the riots. Ali suffers a panic attack. The jail doctor arrives and strangles Ali, declaring him dead by suicide. The doctor is Anwar's daughter, who is bedridden with full-body paralysis.

Freddy is released from jail and enters the mosque where Ali's last rites are performed. He throws a stone at Aboobacker who was inciting communal violence in Ali's name. In a mid-credits scene, Anwar reveals to the media that the riots at Ramadapally were instigated by the police with the help of the government.
