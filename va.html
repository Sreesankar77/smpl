            Vaaranam Aayiram (transl.â€‰A Thousand Elephants) is a 2008 Indian Tamil-language action drama film[1] written and directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The film stars Suriya in the main dual lead role as father and son alongside Simran, Sameera Reddy (in her Tamil debut) and Ramya. The film features music composed by Harris Jayaraj, making Vaaranam Aayiram his last project with Menon before the formal break-up of their partnership, until they worked together again in Yennai Arindhaal (2015). The cinematography for the film was handled by R. Rathnavelu and the editing was done by Anthony Gonsalvez.

            The film illustrates Suriya, an Indian Army Major who learns about his father Krishnan's death when he is on a rescue mission. He then starts reminiscing about the bond he shared with Krishnan and the stories related to him. The storyline was inspired by Menon's life, when he heard the news about his father's death back in 2007, also serving as a tribute to him. Filmed across India and the United States, Vaaranam Aayiram had been under production since November 2006 and was completed in August 2008. The film was theatrically released on 14 November 2008, after multiple postponements, and opened to critical acclaim, with praise for Suriya's dual role performance and Harris Jayaraj's soundtrack. Further, the film also became a commercial success, eventually becoming the biggest hit in Suriya's career at that time. It won a number of awards, including the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil.[2] The film has attained cult status over time.[3]

                After an elderly Krishnan returns home from a hair cut, he vomits blood in the bathroom and dies. His son Suriya, a Major in the Indian Army, is on the way to Kashmir on a rescue mission to save a journalist kidnapped by terrorists. He learns of his father's sudden death and tearfully reminisces about his past with him.

Flashback to where we see a young Krishnan and Malini who were both students at Madras Christian College in the 1970s. They fall in love and later get married & have two kids named Suriya and Shriya. Krishnan and Suriya get along more as friends than as a father-son duo. Years later, after Suriya completes his exams in Tiruchirappalli, he meets the beautiful Meghna on a train back home and falls head over heels for her, but she does not believe in love at first sight. He goes to her house & tries again to fall in love with her but then he soon learns that she is leaving for California to pursue her master's degree.

Meanwhile, back at the home front, Krishnan suffers his first heart attack due to chain smoking. Reality strikes and Suriya realizes that he needs to step up & be responsible in order to take care of his family. He starts a design firm with his friends and also performs at concerts to earn money. Both Suriya and Shriya earn enough to complete their father's dream home. Later, taking his father's advice, Suriya tracks down Meghna in San Francisco. Though surprised by his presence, she makes him stay with her. She eventually starts to fall in love with him. Convinced that he is the right guy and also because her father would accept a person like him, she proposes to Suriya much to his and his family's delight. She then leaves for Oklahoma City on a project. As he travels to surprise her, she loses her life in the Oklahoma City bombing, leaving Suriya depressed and heartbroken.

A depressed Suriya returns to India and meets a businessman named Shankar Menon on the way who consoles and encourages Suriya to move on with his life. Weeks pass by, Suriya tries hanging out with friends, and meets Priya, Shriya's best friend. She proposes to Suriya and confesses that she was in love with him right from their childhood, but Suriya does not reciprocate right away; in fact, her proposal just causes Suriya to have a painful relapse of Meghna's memories to the point that he starts using drugs and alcohol. Krishnan and Malini find out about his drug abuse and lock him up in his room to rehabilitate him. Once he starts withdrawing, Malini encourages Suriya to go on a rejuvenating trip, but on the condition that he returns home as a new man. Suriya travels to Kashmir, where he learns that Aditya, Shankar Menon's son, has been kidnapped in New Delhi. He decides to find Aditya and after days of roaming the city and investigating, he finds Dabbu Malik who directs him to the kidnapper, Asad. With no preparation, he overpowers them and rescues Aditya. He receives critical praise from around the country and from his family upon his return home.

Months later, Suriya realizes that the only way to forget his painful relapse of Meghna's memories is to train his body and prepare for bigger things. He goes on a strict workout and joins the Indian Army as a commissioned officer. Now as Major Suriya Krishnan, after 6 years, he meets Priya in Dehradun. She proposes again and this time he reciprocates; Suriya and Priya get married and eventually have a son. Suddenly, Krishnan is diagnosed with throat cancer due to his smoking habit and is given a year to live. A few days later, Suriya is called upon to go on a mission to rescue a journalist, which brings the scene back to the present day.

The military mission is completed successfully, and Suriya returns home victorious. He tearfully honours Krishnan and performs his last rites. Malini, Suriya, Priya and Shriya pour Krishnan's ashes into the sea and Malini encourages Suriya to move on in life with his family by telling him that he is "the conqueror of 1000 elephants," just like his father, who conquered Malini and made her his life. Suriya looks back and says that his father is still with them. The film ends with an image of Krishnan smiling at them and walking gleefully along the shores.
