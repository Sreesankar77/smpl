            Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (transl. The Brave-Hearted Will Take the Bride), also known by the initialism DDLJ, is a 1995 Indian Hindi-language musical romance film written and directed by Aditya Chopra in his directorial debut and produced by his father Yash Chopra. Released on 20 October 1995, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as Raj and Simran, two young non-resident Indians, who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran's family so the couple can marry, but Simran's father has long since promised her hand to his friend's son. The film was shot in India, London, and Switzerland, from September 1994 to August 1995.

            With an estimated total gross of ₹102.5 crore (today's adjusted gross ₹524 crore), with ₹89 crore (today's adjusted gross ₹455 crore) earned in India and ₹13.50 crore (today's adjusted gross ₹69 crore) in overseas,[2] the film was the highest-grossing Indian film of 1995 and one of the most successful Indian films in history. When adjusted for inflation, it is the second highest-grossing Indian film of the 1990s, behind Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! It won 10 Filmfare Awards—the most for a single film at that time—and the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.
            
            The film received widespread acclaim from critics. Many critics praised performances of Kajol and Khan as well as their chemistry, and the film's blend of simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other filmmakers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style and homages to specific scenes. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute's list of top Indian films of all time. In 2012, the film was included by critics Rachel Dwyer and Sanam Hasan in the 2012 British Film Institute Sight & Sound 1,000 greatest films of all time.[3] The film is considered to be the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema, as its still being shown at the Maratha Mandir in Mumbai since its release on 20 October 1995, as of March 2025.[4][5]

Simran lives with her conservative family in the suburbs of London. Her father, Baldev, is a strict disciplinarian, who does not encourage spending time outside or engaged in frivolous activities. Simran has been betrothed since birth, to marry a man named Kuljeet, who is the son of Baldev's friend, Ajit, in Punjab.

Following their graduation, Simran's friends wish to travel across Europe. Simran asks her father for permission to go on the trip, and he agrees. Also on the trip, in a separate party, is Raj, who is accompanying his friends despite having failed in college. Raj and Simran meet on the train, and immediately dislike each other. Raj is flirtatious with every girl he meets, but Simran prefers to keep to herself.

While stopping at Zurich, Raj and Simran both try to buy souvenirs and end up missing their train. Stranded alone in a foreign country, they decide to travel together to catch up with the rest of their group. Simran opens up to Raj, who confesses having had many girlfriends. Eventually, they reunite with their friends towards the end of the trip, but both have fallen in love with each other. When Simran's father hears of this, he immediately moves the family to Punjab so Simran can marry Kuljeet.

Raj shows up at Simran's London address, but finds out that she has left. He follows her to India, where they reunite in the village outside her current residence. Raj and Simran wish to marry, but Raj does not want her to elope with him. Instead, he hopes to win over Simran's family during the months-long festivities before the wedding, so that they can agree to the match themselves. He befriends Kuljeet while out hunting, and Kuljeet unwittingly introduces Raj to his and Simran's family.

Raj stays at Kuljeet's house, and becomes the center of the wedding party. He attracts the attention of Kuljeet's sister, Preeti, during his stay, and Preeti's parents decide to ask Raj's father to arrange their marriage. Raj's father, Dharamvir, arrives in Punjab and immediately agrees to the match, not knowing that Raj is in love with Simran and not Preeti. On the eve of Simran's wedding, Raj and Simran discuss eloping again, but Raj rejects the idea.

The next day, Baldev discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran in Europe. He realises Raj is the boy she fell in love with on her trip, and throws Raj out of the house. At the train station, Raj and Kuljeet start brawling. Raj wins the fight, but spares his life. As the train is about to depart, Simran begs Baldev to let her go with Raj. Seeing the love his daughter feels for him, Baldev agrees. Raj pulls Simran on the train, similar to the way they first met in London.
