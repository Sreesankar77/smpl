            Baazigar (transl. Gambler) is a 1993 Indian Hindi-language crime thriller film directed by Abbas–Mustan and produced by Venus Movies. It stars Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role alongside Kajol, Siddharth, Shilpa Shetty (in her film debut), Raakhee, Dalip Tahil, and Johnny Lever. Its soundtrack was composed by Anu Malik. The film follows a young man seeking to avenge the fall of his family by going on a murderous rampage.

            The story is loosely based on Ira Levin's 1953 novel A Kiss Before Dying and its 1991 film adaptation of the same name.[3] Baazigar proved to be Khan's breakthrough role as the sole lead (his first as an antihero), in addition to Kajol's first commercial success and Shetty's film debut.[4][5]
            
            Baazigar was released on 12 November 1993, coinciding with the festival of Diwali.[6] Made on a budget of ₹40 million, the film was declared a blockbuster at the box office with a worldwide gross of ₹320 million, ranking as the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year.[7] Apart from emerging as a major financial success, the film has become a cult film over the years due to its suspense, story, screenplay, soundtrack and performances of the cast.[8] It was the first collaboration between Khan and Kajol, who went on to become one of India's most iconic on-screen couples. It helped establish Khan, Kajol, Shetty and Malik in Hindi films, and the soundtrack sold over 10 million units, thus becoming the highest-selling album of the year.[9]
            
            At the 39th Filmfare Awards, Baazigar received 10 nominations, including Best Film, Best Supporting Actress and Best Female Debut (both for Shetty), and won 4 awards, including Best Actor (Khan) and Best Music Director (Malik).[10]

                Madan Chopra, a wealthy businessman, has two daughters—Seema and Priya. During a car race in Madras, Chopra meets Vicky Malhotra, a seemingly charming young man who allows him to win the race to earn his trust. Chopra becomes impressed by Vicky, and Priya gradually falls in love with him. However, Vicky is revealed to be Ajay Sharma, who has assumed a false identity to take revenge on Chopra.

Seema, who is in a secret relationship with Ajay, faces pressure from her father to marry someone else. Ajay tricks her into writing a suicide note and later pushes her off a building, staging her death as a suicide. To avoid scandal, Chopra quickly closes the case. Suspicious of her sister’s death, Priya begins investigating with the help of Inspector Karan Saxena, an old college friend.

Seema’s friend Ravi discovers a photograph of Seema and Ajay together. Before Priya can see it, Ajay kills Ravi and forces him to write a suicide note, framing him as Seema's murderer. Meanwhile, Chopra plans Priya’s engagement to Vicky, still unaware of his true identity.

Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Chopra once worked for Ajay’s father, Mr. Sharma. When Sharma caught him embezzling company funds, Chopra was jailed. Upon his release, Chopra pretended to repent but betrayed Sharma when he gave Madan power of attorney, taking over his business and leaving the Sharma family destitute. This led to Sharma’s death from a heart attack, the death of Ajay’s baby sister, and his mother Shobna’s mental breakdown. Witnessing Chopra's cruelty, Ajay vowed to destroy him.

Back in the present, Priya meets the real Vicky Malhotra and begins to suspect Ajay. She discovers a locket with photos of Ajay and Seema, confirming her suspicions and confronts Ajay who reveals Chopra's theft of his family's wealth to a shocked Priya who feels sympathy for him despite his crimes. Chopra, becomes aware of Ajay’s identity after giving him power of attorney which Ajay uses to steal his company. Chopra confronts him at his home with goons. A brutal fight ensues, during which Chopra's goons badly beat Ajay and Madan hits Shobna, who regains her sanity upon hearing Madan's voice. In the end, Ajay fights back but Chopra fatally impales Ajay with a rod, but Ajay retaliates, fatally wounding Chopra who dies immediately. A wounded Ajay struggles back to his mother, promising her he has reclaimed everything that was meant to be their's. Now only wanting to rest peacefully in his mothers arms, a despondent Priya and Karan watch as Ajay dies in his mothers arms, finally at peace.
