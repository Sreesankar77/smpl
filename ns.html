                Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, aka Ram, is a Travel photographer. Ram visits his High School and is overcome by memories. Ram had been added into their batch WhatsApp group, and a reunion was arranged through their school WhatsApp group. At the reunion, Ram's friends Murali, Subhashini, and Sathish catch up with Ram. Murali hesitantly mentions that Janaki Devi Saravanan aka Jaanu (Ram's childhood lover) is visiting the reunion from Singapore.

In 1994 (The reunion says 96 as the rest of the class continued their education but Ram left the school and village), Ram and Jaanu were friends and classmates in 10th grade. Jaanu was a talented singer. Ram developed a love for Jaanu, and Jaanu reciprocated Ram's love. Once their board exams were over, Ram and Jaanu had a moment with each other where Jaanu asked Ram not to forget her until they met again after the holidays.

Back in the present, Jaanu arrives at the reunion from Singapore, and she searches for Ram. When Subha points Ram to Jaanu, Jaanu walks towards Ram. Jaanu reminisces about the 1st day of 11th grade when Jaanu waited for Ram's arrival at the classroom, but Ram did not arrive. Jaanu finds that Ram has left the school because his father had financial difficulties and his family relocated to Madras (now Chennai). Jaanu was heartbroken, and she thought of Ram only until she completed school.

Back in the present, Ram and Jaanu finally meet and find it uncomfortable to interact with each other, but they gradually get along. Ram and Jaanu's friends talk about Jaanu's married life in Singapore and disclose that Ram is still single and unmarried. After the reunion party, Ram and Jaanu go out on a drive. Jaanu reveals how she could not forget Ram and would have traded anything just to have met him once. Jaanu narrates how circumstances forced her to marry someone else. Then, Ram asks Jaanu if she really does not remember the day he came to her college to meet her. Ram says that he and Murali waited in front of Jaanu's college to meet her and passed on a message through a student. Surprisingly, Jaanu refused to meet Ram, and she told him not to contact her again. Ram returned sadly, and he hadn't tried to meet Jaanu since then. Jaanu is devastated after listening to this and reveals that she never saw them at her college and thought it was her stalker who was troubling her. Ram says that except for the mistake of assuming that Jaanu hated Ram, he knew everything about her life. Jaanu was heartbroken because she felt Ram's presence at her wedding, and she expected Ram to come for her until the last minute. Ram and Jaanu feel sad about their misfortune and finally come to terms with everything that has happened in their lives. Jaanu expresses her desire to spend the final few hours with Ram before she catches the flight back to Singapore.

Ram and Jaanu go out into the city to catch up on more memories. There, they meet Ram's photography students, who assume Jaanu is Ram's wife and request her to share their story. Jaanu obliges and narrates an improvised version of the time when Ram tried to meet Jaanu at her college. Jaanu tells about how they finally met and made up and have been together ever since. Despite feeling awkward, Ram tries his best to play along. The students leave, and Ram suggests Jaanu to rest at his home. On the way, Ram and Jaanu get drenched in the rain, and Ram gives some of his dry clothes to Jaanu, and Jaanu wears Ram's clothes.

At Ram's home, Jaanu is visibly upset that Ram is unmarried, and she requests him to marry. Jaanu finally sings Ram's favourite song, "Yamunai Aatrile", from the film Thalapathi (1991), which Jaanu was purposefully avoided singing in the School despite Ram's requests. Ram shows Jaanu a treasured collection of their School Memories, like Love Poems, Dried Flowers, and their School Uniforms. Ram and Jaanu realise that time is running out and go to Jaanu's hotel so Jaanu can get ready for her flight in a few hours. Jaanu is sad that she will leave Chennai and Ram very soon. At the airport, Ram escorts Jaanu to the boarding gate, and they bid a teary farewell. Jaanu then boards the flight and leaves

Back at Ram's home, Ram finds Jaanu's clothes that he had put to dry the previous night. Ram folds Jaanu's clothes neatly, he puts them along with his treasured collection of School Memories, and he shuts the suitcase as the screen cuts to black.
