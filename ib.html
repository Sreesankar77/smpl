            Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 action war film[8] written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Til Schweiger and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells an alternate history story of two converging plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's leadership at a Paris cinema—one through a British operation largely carried out by a team of Jewish American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt), and another by French Jewish cinema proprietor Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent) who seeks to avenge her murdered family. Both are faced against Hans Landa (Waltz), an SS colonel with a fearsome reputation for hunting Jews.

            The title (but not the story) was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Euro War film The Inglorious Bastards, but deliberately misspelled as "a Basquiat-esque touch".[9] Tarantino wrote the script in 1998, but struggled with the ending and chose instead to direct the two-part film Kill Bill. After directing Death Proof in 2007, Tarantino returned to work on Inglourious Basterds. A co-production of the United States and Germany, the film began principal photography in October 2008 and was filmed in Germany and France with a $70 million production budget. It premiered on May 20, 2009, at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in theaters in the United States and Europe in August 2009 by the Weinstein Company and Universal Pictures.
            
            Inglourious Basterds grossed $321 million worldwide, making it Tarantino's highest-grossing film to that point, until it was surpassed by Django Unchained (2012). The film received critical acclaim, with Waltz's performance as Hans Landa being singled out for praise, but some criticized the historical liberties taken. It also won multiple awards and nominations, among them eight Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay). For his role as Landa, Waltz won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor Award, as well as the BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, Critics' Choice, Golden Globe, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

                n 1941, Austrian SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite about a fugitive Jewish family, the Dreyfuses. Landa boasts about his nickname, "The Jew Hunter," then urges LaPadite to give up the Dreyfuses for the safety of his own family. LaPadite tearfully admits that they are hiding under his floor. Landa's men massacre the family but one of them, young Shosanna, escapes unharmed.

Three years later, U.S. Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the "Basterds," a black ops commando unit tasked with instilling fear among Nazis in occupied France by killing and scalping them. The group includes Sergeant Donny "The Bear Jew" Donowitz, Privates First Class Smithson Utivich and Omar Ulmer, rogue German Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, and Austrian-born translator Corporal Wilhelm Wicki. Raine leaves a swastika mark on all surviving German soldiers as a way to make their Nazi affiliations clear even after the war.

In Paris, Shosanna operates a cinema under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux, and meets Fredrick Zoller, a famed German sniper set to star in the German propaganda film Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride). Infatuated with "Emmanuelle," Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the film's premiere at her cinema. Landa, as the premiere's head of security, interrogates Shosanna but does not reveal if he recognizes her. She plots with her Afro-French lover and projectionist, Marcel, to kill the German leaders by burning down the cinema with her collection of highly flammable nitrate films.

British Commando Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a former film critic and fluent German speaker, is recruited for Operation Kino, an attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Disguised as German officers, Hicox, Stiglitz, and Wicki meet with German film star Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent, at a tavern in Nazi-occupied northern France. Hicox's unusual accent arouses suspicion from Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Major Dieter Hellström, and he blows the group's cover with a non-German hand gesture. A gunfight ensues, killing everyone except Wilhelm and a wounded von Hammersmark. Raine arrives and negotiates for von Hammersmark's release, giving her a chance to shoot Wilhelm. Raine tortures von Hammersmark, believing she set his men up, but she convinces him of her loyalty to the Allies and reveals that Hitler will be attending the premiere. She proposes that Raine, Donowitz and Ulmer attend the premiere posing as Italian filmmakers, remarking that Germans do not recognize Italian accents. Landa investigates the tavern and finds von Hammersmark's shoe and a napkin with her signature.

The Basterds infiltrate the premiere with timed explosives. Landa, who is fluent in Italian, readily sees through their cover and confronts von Hammersmark with her missing shoe before strangling her to death. He has Raine arrested along with Utivich, whom he has also detected, but leaves Ulmer and Donowitz in the theater. Recognizing the opportunity of his situation, Landa offers to let the attack proceed if Raine's OSS commanders will guarantee his safety after the war. Raine contacts his commanders and Landa negotiates a generous deal for himself and his radio operator.

During the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection booth and berates Shosanna for rejecting his advances, leading them to shoot each other dead. As Nation's Pride reaches its climax, Shosanna's face appears on the screen telling the Nazi audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked the auditorium, Marcel ignites a pile of nitrate film behind the screen with his cigarette, setting the theater ablaze (killing himself in the process). Ulmer and Donowitz break into the opera box, gunning down Hitler and Goebbels, before firing into the crowd until their explosives kill everyone inside the cinema.

Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender to Raine. Raine shoots the radio operator and triumphantly carves a swastika into Landa's forehead.
