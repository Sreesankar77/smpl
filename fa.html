            Fallen Angels is a 1995 Hong Kong neo-noir crime comedy-drama film[3][4] written and directed by Wong Kar-wai. It features two intertwined storylines—one tells the story of a hitman wishing to leave the criminal underworld (Leon Lai), the prostitute he starts a relationship with (Karen Mok), and his agent (Michelle Reis), who is infatuated with him. The other story is of a mute ex-convict on the run from the police (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and a mentally unstable woman dumped by her boyfriend (Charlie Yeung). Set in 1995 pre-Handover Hong Kong, Fallen Angels explores the characters' loneliness, their alienation from the situations around them, and yearning for connections in a hectic city.

            Wong initially wrote Fallen Angels as the third story of his preceding film, Chungking Express (1994), but split them into two separate projects due to their cumulative length. Similar to Chungking Express, Fallen Angels features a fragmented narrative that emphasises mood and atmosphere over structure. Whereas its predecessor incorporates bright daytime colours, Fallen Angels consists of scenes exclusively shot at night and using darker colours alongside bright neons. Wong considered the two movies to be complementary counterparts exploring contemporary Hong Kong. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle extensively used wide-angle lens to distort the characters' faces on the screen, conveying their isolation from the surrounding world. Doyle also creates distorted tension in scenes of extreme violence with frantic, out-of-focus visuals. The soundtrack extensively uses trip hop and pop songs to convey mood and maintain an "urban environment" that plays with popular culture.
            
            Fallen Angels was released in September 1995. Upon release, critics commented that its styles resembled those deployed in Chungking Express; many lamented that Wong had become self-indulgent, though as time went on critics began to be more appreciative of the film. At the 15th Hong Kong Film Awards in 1996, it won three awards: Best Supporting Actress for Mok, Best Cinematography for Doyle, and Best Original Score for Roel A. Garcia and Frankie Chan. Retrospectively, critics commented that though Fallen Angels was not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it remained one of Wong's most captivating films, cementing his trademark styles. The film's abstract, unconventional style, the context in which it was made, and its use of pastiche and intertextuality with regards to both popular culture and its predecessor Chungking Express have led to the movie being described as a postmodern film and as suggesting a postmodern reading.
            
            Since its release, Fallen Angels has encompassed a large cult following, and is notable for being the last film Wong fully shot in his native Hong Kong before embarking on more ambitious international productions.[5]

                Hitman Wong Chi-ming and a woman he calls his "partner" talk while smoking cigarettes. After Wong responds to the partner's question of if they are still partners, the scene cuts into the story.

The pair, despite being business partners for nearly three years, rarely meet, exchanging their assassination plans via letters and faxes. The partner cleans the hitman's cramped apartment, buys his groceries, and faxes blueprints of assassination locations. Obsessed with Wong and infatuated with his mysterious nature, she analyzes his trash. After a successful assassination, Wong runs into Ah-Hoi, an old classmate who recognises him. The old classmate tries to sell him an insurance policy, but remembering he does not have a beneficiary, Wong declines.

The partner goes to a bar Wong frequents and daydreams about him. After playing a piece of music on the bar jukebox, the partner returns to her apartment and masturbates to the thought of Wong. Afterwards, she encounters Ho Chi-mo, a mute ex-convict on the run from the police in her apartment building. During their second killing of the night, Wong and his partner look for each other in the area. The job is successful, but Wong is shot in the arm.

Increasingly frustrated by the monotone, futile life of contract killing and his lack of free will, Wong quits and sets up a meeting with his partner but no-shows. Certain that she will show up at the bar in a couple of days looking for him, he asks the bartender to suggest a piece of music on the jukebox called "Forget Him" (忘記他) with the number "1818". After listening, the partner cries alone at the bar. Meanwhile, Wong has a late night meal at McDonald's, where he encounters an eccentric woman nicknamed "Blondie", who sits next to him and invites him into her apartment. While they spend time together, the scene is juxtaposed against the hitman's partner masturbating until she breaks down crying.

Blondie believes Wong is the ex-lover who left her for another woman (likely the hitman's partner). Meanwhile, the hitman's partner walks past Blondie in a subway station and the two turn back and look at each other. The partner detects Wong's scent on Blondie, suggesting she knows about the relationship.

After Wong and his partner meet again, he tells her he wants to terminate their business relationship. She asks that he do one more job. Afterwards, Wong breaks off his relationship with Blondie, leaving her heartbroken before she bites him to leave her mark on him. The hitman sets out for his final killing job while the hitman's partner makes a phone call that gives away Wong's location to rivals – revealing the job to be a set-up. Wong drinks alcohol and braces himself in the bathroom for a tense showdown before being killed by his rivals. Wong however is pleased that he has finally been able to achieve free will—the free will to make his own decisions and die.

The chaotic Chungking Mansions, where the hitman's partner lives, is also home to Ho Chi-mo, an ex-convict who has escaped prison and is on the run from the police. Recognising their shared backgrounds in criminality, she helps him elude the police when they search for him. Ho is mute and lives with his father. For work, he breaks into other people's businesses at night and sells their goods and services, often forcibly to unwilling customers. He keeps running into the same girl at night, Charlie. Every time they meet, she cries on his shoulder and tells him the same sob story. Her ex-boyfriend, Johnny, left her for a girl named Blondie. She enlists his help in searching for Blondie and Ho Chi-mo falls in love with her. Later, she stands him up and he changes his ways, beginning a friendship and work relationship with a restaurant manager. He begins to film things around him with a video camera. His father passes away, and Ho watches the videos filmed to remember him. He falls back into abusive habits, going so far as to cut off the hair of a man whose family he in the past forced to eat an excessive amount of ice cream. He and Charlie do not come into contact for a few months, but they run into each other while he is masquerading as a business owner. She is in a stewardess uniform and in a new relationship. She does not acknowledge him.

Some time later, the partner narrates that she decided to never again be personally involved with her hitmen in the aftermath of Wong's death. Nearby, Ho Chi-mo is also alone when he is beaten up by a local gang. Seeing this, the partner realises that Ho is feeling the same sense of loss as her. They go for a ride on Ho Chi-mo's motorbike. He narrates that while there is no chemistry there is still some kind of connection. As they ride through early-hours Hong Kong they cross through the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in scenes evocative of those of Ho Chi-mo and Charlie earlier in the film, with the light of dawn being the only instance of daytime in the movie. The partner comments that even though it is just temporary and that she has not been close to a man in ages, she enjoys the warmth he brings in the moment.
